# Beginning-C-Programming---From-Beginner-to-Beyond-Problem-solutions
My own solutions to problems at the end of each chapter from udemy Beginning C++ Programming From Beginner to Beyond by Frank J. Mitropoulos. The top rated C++ course on Udemy. The challenges include:
  
    - Menu-based program that prompt the user to choose one many options include displaying content of a vector, add numbers to the vector, find the mean or average, find the smallest as well as the largest number in the list.
    - Encryption - Decryption (Characters and string) Program that prompt the user to enter a text and it encrypts it using simple subtition algorithms.
    -  In the function chapter, I updated the same menu-based program but in this case I used function for each option to make the program simpler to read and faster to display.
    - In pointer challenge, I created a pass-by-reference function using pointers as arguments and compute the product of two vectors or lists.
